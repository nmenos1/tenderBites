Advantages and Disadvantages of Technology in Agriculture Arshad Ali*1, Muhammad Umair Yasin1­, Muhammad Sajid1 and Muhammad Amjid1. Genetically modified produce can be harvested when ripe, and the . In agriculture, there are concerns that genetically modified crops may transfer genetic material into natural, unmodified plants. Technology disadvantages are losses, inefficiencies and poor outcomes that result from inappropriate use, management or design of information technology. In the wrong hands, biotechnology can even create weapons of mass destruction. By now biotechnology has made much progress in the field of science and technology by introducing technology like gene cloning, new breeding methods, biochemistry, medical advancements, agricultural advancements . Paul Berg made the first recombinant DNA molecule in 1972 by combining a lambda virus with the monkey virus SV40. You can have it involved in medical processes, marine processes, and agricultural processes. The risks are: 1. Its benefits are considerable, but so are the negatives of biotechnology. Disadvantages of Nanotechnology When tackling the advantages and disadvantages of nanotechnology, you will also need to point out what can be seen as the negative side of this technology: Included in the list of disadvantages of this science and its development is the possible loss of jobs in the traditional farming and manufacturing industry. These products are not in everyday use but may be of benefit to us in the future. Biotechnology is the application of scientific techniques to modify and improve plants, animals, and microor­ Genetically modified crops or food can in­crease the yield and in less time, many . Biotechnology ranges from brewing beer to genetically engineering crops to making enzymes into cleaning products. In assessing the benefits and risks involved in the use of modern biotechnology, there are a series of issues to be addressed so that informed decisions may be made as to the appropriateness of the use of modern biotechnology when seeking solutions to current problems in food, agriculture, and natural resources management. Springer Verlag. 1. For example, human insulin, a small protein used to treat diabetes, is made in genetically engineered bacteria, whereas large, more complex proteins like hormones or antibodies are made in mammalian cells or transgenic animals.

There are numerous discussions about the development and use of modern biotechnology, especially about the safety of genetically modified foods. One fear from the use of biotechnology is that the genes could be transferred to other crops which they are not intended to go in and lead . The development of modern biotechnology in food occurs rapidly simultaneously with the development of other technologies. Unpasteurised milk is placed in a skin pouch during the procedure. One of the biggest problems that biotechnology faces is a lack of genetic diversity. The following points highlight the four major risks of modern biotechnology. In the first place, there is a knee-jerk reaction against genetic manipulation. The use of this business model has led to many advantages and disadvantages within the biotechnology industry. Traditional agriculture practices like slash &amp; burn decrease soil organic matter.This leads to rapid depletion of nutrients and fertility in the soil, meaning after a while yields start declining, and farmers move to another plot of land to start again. Many biotechnology companies are engaged in these sophisticated, but noncontroversial, technologies. . Although it has many benefits — including lowering our environmental footprint, and helping treat disease and illness — it doesn&#x27;t come without its disadvantages. Rabies is a widespread zoonotic disease responsible for approximately 55,000 human deaths/year. This process occurs when there is direct manipulation of the genetic material through the use of biotechnology. Biotechnology may not deliver every benefit that we can imagine, but a great number of these and other advantages will very likely materialize. Biotechnology has indeed done a lot of good for the world, but it also has disadvantages, and there are some concerns about its potential negative impacts. Biotechnology is thus linked to genetic engineering and emerged as a field in its own right at the beginning of the 20th century in the food industry , which was later joined by other sectors such as medicine and the . The production of a traditional South African beverage called Amasi is a form of biotechnology. It creates an all-or-nothing approach. Biotechnology has been central to these advances, progressively offering the ability to make more complicated medicines and vaccines, opening up the treatment and prevention of a broader set of diseases. According to International Unions of Pure and Applied Chemistry (1981) biotechnology is the application of biochemistry, biology, and microbiology, chemical engineering to industrial processes, products and on the environment (Bull et al, 1982). For example, one application of biotechnology is the directed use of microorganisms for the manufacture of organic products .
