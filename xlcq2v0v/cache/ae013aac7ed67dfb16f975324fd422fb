Diabetes Mellitus Definition Diabetes mellitus is a condition in which the pancreas no longer produces enough insulin or cells stop responding to the insulin that is produced, so that glucose in the blood cannot be absorbed into the cells of the body. 1. To determine the effects of very-low-calorie diets on the metabolic abnormalities of diabetes and obesity, we have studied 10 obese, non-insulin-dependent diabetic (NIDDM) and 5 obese, nondiabetic subjects for 36 days on a metabolic ward during consumption of a liquid diet of 300 kcal/day with 30 g of protein.

To determine whether high-ketogenic very-low-energy diets (VLEDs) can reduce hepatic glucose output (HGO) and hyperglycemia more effectively than can low-ketogenic VLEDs in obese patients with non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), seven patients were treated with a high-ketogenic VLED for 3 wk and were compared with six patients treated with a low-ketogenic VLED. —Cohort study.

Type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a chronic disease of elevated plasma glucose levels resulting from a failure of the pancreas to produce sufficient insulin and/or peripheral tissues to respond to insulin (i.e., insulin resistance).
