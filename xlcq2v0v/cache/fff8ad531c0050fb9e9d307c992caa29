Dangers that are shoaler are portrayed with the unique ECDIS &quot;isolated danger&quot; symbol shown at left. The Isolated Danger Symbol is displayed if any underwater feature like wrecks, rocks or other obstructions has a depth less than the safety contour in waters beyond the safety contour. In this case, if the safety contour value were set to 10m the symbol would change back to a wreck. 2. Isolated Danger symbol which seems to turn itself on and off with a will of its own. The Safety Contour will also detect isolated dangers and trigger the anti-grounding alarm. CHART DISPLAY AND INFORMATION SYSTEM. It is erected or moored above the hazard.

Another advantage that ECDIS provides over paper charts is enabling users to obtain more information about a feature through a &quot;cursor pick . This isolated danger is just what it means, it is a danger but has safe water all around it and hazard is not therefore spread over a large area.
