An example of such a process is shown in Figure 2. Pharmaceutical industry in Iran has a long history. The advantages of successful technology transfer can be felt through national and regional economies via growth through innovation, new ventures and stronger industry to boost employment. Technology transfer embodies both the transfer of documentation and the demonstrated ability of the receiving unit (RU) to effectively perform the critical elements of the transferred technology, to the satisfaction of all parties and any applicable regulatory bodies. An equally significant cause of software development failure is the failure of the technology transfer process. the technology transfer have connected technology directly with knowledge and more attention is given to the process. For successful execution of the transfer plan, both the SU and the RU have multiple responsibilities, as defined in Figure 3.  ; s the importance of Green Chemistry in Pharmaceuticals field importance of technology transfer in pharmaceutical industry slideshare 1 process that involves many....
