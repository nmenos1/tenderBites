List the indexes for characterizing the coarse aggregate abrasion resistance, surface texture of fine aggregate, and clay content of fine aggregate.Describe whether a larger or smaller value for each of these indexes leads to a better bituminous mixture performance, and explain the reason. Coarse aggregates are larger size filler materials in construction. This mixture is then discharged into a ready mix truck (also known as a concrete transport truck). The purpose of the fine aggregate is to fill the voids in the coarse aggregate and to act as a workability agent. Fine aggregates generally consist of natural sand or crushed stone with most particles passing through a 3/8-inch sieve. Of the two test methods evaluated for use with coarse aggregate, AASHTO T 85 provided better precision. This item is frequently alluded to as 1/4â³ short as it alludes to the size, or evaluation, of this specific aggregate. For increased workability and for economy as reflected by use of less cement, the fine aggregate should have a rounded shape. Fine aggregates comprise regular sand or any squashed stone particles that are 1/4â³ or smaller. SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF FINE AND COARSE AGGREGATES FINE AGGREGATES COARSE AGGREGATES Specific Required Amount of Water = W/C Ratio X Cement Volume Coarse and fine aggregate comprises almost up to 75% of total concrete volume, therefore, balancing the usage of FA and CA plays vital role in determining the performance and quality of the concrete. Coarse aggregate is any material whose particles are anywhere from 3/8 inches and 1.5 inches in width. Coarse aggregates are the particles that retain on 4.75 mm sieve. AIM OF THE EXPERIMENT: To determine the gradation of coarse aggregate by sieve analysis. Fine aggregate; Coarse aggregate; Fine Aggregate When the aggregate is sieved through a 4.75mm sieve, the aggregate passed through it called fine aggregate. The effective proportioning is carried out by using the fine aggregates modulus whereas the one of coarse aggregates is less affective for the mixture compatibility and design. The term fineness modulus (F.M) is a ready index of coarseness or fineness of material. These aggregates meet the requirements of Section 701.01 AGGREGATE FOR CONCRETE of the Standard Specification with the exception of Coarse Aggregate #2. Attachment 11 - Abrasive A: Gradation Analysis, of this Invitation for Bids, is to be used for recording the Bulk density of coarse aggregate and their specific gravity along with bulk density of cement fine aggregate and coarse aggregate and specific gravity of coarse aggregate and cement is quite helpful in finding in design of mix concrete like M20,M25,M30 and so on- . The size of the coarse aggregate determines the cement to water ratio Less water means a stronger mix, but it also becomes less workable. ).
