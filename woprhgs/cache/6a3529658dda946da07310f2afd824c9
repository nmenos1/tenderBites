HEC-RAS is an integrated system of software, designed for interactive use in a multi-tasking, multi-user network environment. Equivalent Diameter As a fluid is forced from one point to another, certain forces act on the fluid that cause it to lose and in one case (the case of elevation) potentially gain pressure. Hydraulic diameter - d h - is the "characteristic length" used to calculate the dimensionless Reynolds Number to determine if a flow is turbulent or laminar.
