The aim of the present study was to validate the Taiwanese version of the Apathy Evaluation Scale, clinician version (AES-C) and assess the severity of apathy in patients with AD. Objective: To compare the AES sub-scales—subject-reported (AES-S), informant-reported (AES-I), and clinician-reported (AES-C)—over time and investigate apathy&#x27;s relation to cortical atrophy in MCI and cognitively normal (CN) elderly. It is one of the most common symptoms in dementia. A total of 38 informants agreed to complete the questionnaire as a proxy to a first-degree relative who sustained a TBI as a result of RTA. Apathy is typically measured using self- (patient), informant-, or clinician-rated scales.

Apathy Evaluation Scale. 2018 Feb;72(2):157 Assessment of the Psychometric Properties of the Apathy Evaluation Scale. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is an 18-item measure of the psychological dimension of lack of motivation. A score of ≥42 indicates an apathy syndrome. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES; Marin et al., 1991) was developed alongside the original definition of apathy, and exists in clinician (AES-C), informant (AES-I), and self-rated (AES-S) versions. Apathy was also assessed in a patient-based interview using the LARS and the informant- and clinician-rated versions of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES). It is a frequent consequence of neurological and psychiatric disorders. 2007. Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms (SANS) and Positive and Negative Symptom Scale (PANSS) are not included since primarily used in patients with schizophrenia. The questionnaire contained the apathy evaluation scale (AES) to diagnose apathy and the patient health question-naire-9 (PHQ-9) to differentiate between apathy and depression. c Pleasurable Activities List—How pleasurable the participant rates a pleasurable activity. Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES-I) [ Time Frame: 10 weeks ] The influence of Bupropion compared to placebo on the change of apathy as quantified by the apathy evaluation scale (AES-I, where I [informant] is a friend or family member familiar with the daily activities of the subject) in patients with HD after ten weeks of treatment. For the clinician and informant versions of the scale, two factors were identified which accounted for 51.1% and 54.4% of the variance, respectively.

Link to Instrument Instrument Details Acronym AES Cost Free Diagnosis/Conditions Brain Injury We evaluated the psychometric properties of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) in a sample of PD patients.

Two thirds of the patients with apathy were also depressed, suggesting that apathy in PD is a frequent comorbid Apathy is one of the core neuropsychiatric symptoms that has been investigated in recent years; research is however hampered by the limited availability of well‐evaluated apathy scales for these patients. Objective 24. The Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) is a promising tool for measurement of apathy in prodromal and possibly preclinical AD. Abstract. However, it should be noticed that emotional apathy as measured by the AES is based . They used the Apathy Scale to rate its severity, and the diagnosis was made based on a cutoff score on this instrument. Method Information for the IA can be obtained from the patient or from a caregiver.

This led to the development of the Apathy Evaluation Scale (AES) to characterize and quantify apathy in individuals ages 55 and older.
