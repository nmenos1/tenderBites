In order to operate this cycle where each event is accomplished in a very short time, the engine requires a number of special arrangements. The parts of a 2-stroke petrol engine work this way, and the parts of a 2-stroke diesel engine work similarly except it has a fuel injector instead of a spark plug. There have been three successive series in the EMD line: the 567 series, the 645 series, and the 710 series. VALVE TIMING- TWO STROKE CYCLE (sk: 1.3) Just before the TDC, the fuel injection starts and the power stroke begins just after the TDC.

Large two stroke marine diesel engine have only exhaust valves mounted on the cylinder head. A two-stroke (or two-stroke cycle) engine is a type of internal combustion engine that completes a power cycle with two strokes (up and down movements) of the piston during one power cycle, this power cycle being completed in one revolution of the crankshaft. In 2 Stroke Engine, the charge will be filled with the help of the blower. A common example is the uniflow type where ports are used to introduce air into the cylinder and a valve is used for the exhaust. Turbo-charged 2-stroke Diesel engine.
