Iris prolapse in small incision cataract surgery Abstract Iris prolapse is a rare complication after small incision cataract surgery. We present 2 cases of iris prolapse and inadequate pupil dilation in patients with IFIS.

This can turn a simple surgery into a complicated . Iris prolapse occurs when the iris tissue is observed outside of the wound; iris incarceration occurs when the iris tissue reaches the wound without prolapsing outside the eye. The membrane hasn&#x27;t been open to remove the lens, and there is no artificial lens in its place.

In this patient, both eyes were patched after surgery. Methods: Thirty-two eyes of 20 patients who were using tamsulosin had cataract surgery by the same surgeon using the same technique. He received a toric IOL and achieved a visual acuity of 20/30. A paracentesis was performed with a diamond knife and viscoelastic was used to tease the iris back into position our of the previous surgical incision. &quot;Posterior Capsule Opacity&quot;, a condition arising from the abnormal proliferation and growth of lens epithelial cells on the capsule during the surgery.
