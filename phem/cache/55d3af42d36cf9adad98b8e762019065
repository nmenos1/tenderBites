Reduced blood flow occurs when one or more of these arteries becomes partially or completely blocked. After a normal head CT and discussion with the on-call interventional cardiologist, the patient is taken for percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) where a 99% occlusion of the proximal left circumflex (LCX) is found and thought to be the culprit lesion (Figure 2).

Abstract. The prevalence of anomalous circumflex coronary arteries is rare. Many patients can be treated with medications and a heart-healthy lifestyle, and a procedure such as a stent or bypass is only needed for them when there are disabling and/or progressive symptoms, or the blockage is in a dangerous location. Inclusion criteria were as follows: first STEMI treated with PCI of LAD and additional, visually estimated, significant ( 70 %) narrowing of the Cx (segments 11-13) or RCA (segments 1-3)two-vessel disease. They branch off of the aorta at its base. I just had a catherization this past Monday and the doctor confirmed through a heart cath that I have more blockage than initially shown by the CT Scan angiogram with contrast. The circumflex artery branches off the left coronary artery and encircles the heart muscle.
