Cytology, more commonly known as cell biology,   What is the difference between erythropoiesis and hematopoiesis? How does it differ? These cells  name 3 organs involved in hematopoiesis. Leukopoiesis is a form of hematopoiesis in which white blood cells (WBC, or leukocytes) are formed in bone marrow located in bones in adults and hematopoietic organs in the fetus. White blood cells, indeed all blood cells, are formed from the differentiation of pluripotent hematopoietic stem cells which give rise The main difference between hematopoiesis and  It is triggered by erythropoietin, a kidney hormone produced during hypoxia. We've got the study and writing resources you need for your assignments. The production of erythrocytes is called as Erythropoiesis; the leukocytes are called as Leucopoiesis and that of platelets is Thrombopoiesis. These processes occur in two classes of tissues after birth, myeloid and lymphoid. All blood cells are formed in the bone marrow.

How does it differ? Thus, the key difference between hematopoiesis and erythropoiesis is that hematopoiesis is the overall process of the production of blood cells while erythropoiesis is a part of hematopoiesis which synthesizes red blood cells or erythrocytes.
