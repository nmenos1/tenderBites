Rotation - this is where the limb moves in a circular movement around a. This technique is the one that is behind a backhand stroke or a forehand stroke. If the serve is taught [] Tibia, patella ( knee ): to bend over to hit the lower shots. Although tennis-specific literature is available related to biomechanics and tennis performance (13,15,16,26,30) as well as the sport&#x27;s physiological demands and strength and conditioning program design (4,5,20,21,29,31,32), articles blending these areas are not as readily available.This article focuses on the design of tennis-specific exercises based on the physical demands of . By increasing the length of the lever, this then increases the range of motion at the levers end, therefore increases the speed of the racket (Ackland &amp; Elliot, 2009). INTRODUCTION. .

Each phase will be broken down for the right-hand player and the most important muscles contributing to each phase will be identified. The pectorals are the main muscles engaged in your chest, and the muscles of your shoulders include the deltoids and rotator cuff muscles, a group of four muscles that support the shoulder joint -- the supraspinatus, infraspinatus, teres minor and subscapularis muscles. A study about the proprioceptive angle size of knee joint in the first flat serve produced by tennis players of different performance levels and a strong correlation was found among knee motion and SB and HB. The purpose of this study was to investigate the kinematics and kinetics of tennis flat serve by using different moment of inertia (0.0285, 0.0309, 0.0336, 0.0415 kg*m 2) of racket. This paper outlines the role that biomechanics plays in player development from sport science and sport medicine perspectives. . This occurs at the shoulder joint during an overarm tennis serve. These patterns of muscle activation have not been evaluated in other studies of the tennis serve. The muscles used in the kinetic chain are mostly used as impact, due to the nature of the sport. The serve toss is often quite tricky to master and is often times practiced on its own.  The tennis serve is a very complex system within the sport.
