Here I have implemented Blob Detection for images using Laplacian of Gaussian by creating a Laplacian Scale space via varying image size which helped increase the speed. The Laplacian part comes exactly where alleged smoothing should take place. The spy function is a useful tool for visualizing the pattern of nonzero elements in a matrix. DEDiffusion: this program implement the variant of the PM model in the following paper. No dependencies outside of the MATLAB standard library are required. It amplifies the noise in the image. By analyzing the deterministic relationship between the lower-resolution and the corresponding higher resolution images, we propose two core techniques namely MLF (modified Laplacian filter) and IC (intensity correction) for image resolution enhancement, by which the image size can be increased revealing better details of the image contents. After that I have performed Harris&#x27; Non-Max Suppression and encircled the Blobs. H = fspecial3 ( &#x27;sobel&#x27;, &#x27;Y&#x27; );  If I type: image = imread (&#x27;nameoffile&#x27;); filter = fspecial (&#x27;unsharp&#x27;, 0.5); resultImage = imfilter (image, filter); resultImage is sharper than image. I is my Lenna Image rows and columns are I.rows and I.columns. In order to interpret DFT as a numerical approximation to FFT, we implicitly assume that the input of DFT represents a sample of some periodic signal, whose half-period is represented by this window and the other half by its mirror image. Usage .

I implemented a Laplacian filter for the Lena image, but I get an unexpected output. From what I know, the image needs to be blurred first, and then the blurred image is subtracted from the original to get a sharper image. J = imdilate (I,nhood) dilates the image I, where nhood is a matrix of 0 s and 1 s that specifies the structuring element neighborhood. The off-diagonal entries of L represent the edges in G such that L (i,j) = L (j,i) = -1 if there is an edge between nodes i and j; otherwise, L (i,j) = L (j,i) = 0. If so then a zero crossing is present. October 30, 2018. gradients: the output gradients.
