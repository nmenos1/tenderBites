At the time of writing the Microsoft&#x27;s implementation recenly merged the chrono formatting into the main branch and is known to be not fully conformant. The approach there is very useful, but unfortunately, not cross-platform. For example, a clock may have an epoch of January 1, 1970 and tick every second. For example: using sec = std:: chrono:: duration &lt; double &gt;; std:: string s = std:: format (&quot;{:%S}&quot;, sec (4.2)); // s == &quot;04&quot; (incorrect) 8. Use the Sleep_for () Function to Add a Timed Delay in C++. steady Every tick the clock advances takes the same amount of time (in terms of physical time). Clock, the clock on which this time point is measured. First we capture the portion of the duration which can be represented by a round number of seconds. Represents the length of a period in seconds. The function calls duration_value::zero to obtain the zero value for its internal count object: 1. @bbalaban. It works only on POSIX compliant systems (especially not windows). Finally, here is the API from the beginning of this article, rewritten to use chrono: #include &lt;chrono&gt; std::chrono::duration&lt;int, std::milli&gt; GetGameTime(); void TakeStep(const std::chrono::duration&lt;float&gt; deltaTime); And we can all sleep a little better at night. g++ main.cpp -std=c++0x.
