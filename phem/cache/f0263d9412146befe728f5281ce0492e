Thus, the correct option is (C) A-ii, B-iii, C-iv, D-i. 3. Examples: raffinose and stachyose 4. National Institutes of Health. Unlike raffinose, whose galactose forms a glycosidic bond with the glucose residue of sucrose, planteose has its galactose attached to the fructose moiety of sucrose (Daude, Remaud-Simeon, &amp; Andre . (C 6 H 12 O 6) 10. Oligosaccharides - It is a class of carbohydrates that contain a small number of monosaccharide units, such as three to ten units joined by an o-glycosidic bond: example- raffinose. It has both  and  glycosidic bonds and can therefore be hydrolyzed to d- galactose and sucrose via enzymes with -glycosidic activity, and to melibiose and d -fructose via enzymes with -glycosidic activity. Since the aglycone is really a hemiacetal, lactose undergoes mutarotation. As is evident from its structure (its anomeric carbon atoms are involved in glycosidic bonds), it is a non-reducing sugar. Raffinose finds in beans, cabbage, broccoli, and whole bread. If the aldehyde and ketone functional groups remain tied up in a glycosidic bond (as shown in the structure of raffinose), then they cannot react with the Benedict&#x27;s reagent.
