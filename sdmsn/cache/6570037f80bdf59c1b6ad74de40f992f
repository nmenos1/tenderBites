Single-acting hydraulic cylinders can be used on any type of machinery, but they are commonly used on mobile pieces of machinery including dump trucks and excavators. The function of the SAC is to convert the pressure energy to a mechanical energy (linear motion).  The stroke is limited by the length of the . Maximum sized springs speed piston return and increase spring life. These can be used to attach the Cylinder Rod Pivot. In single-acting cylinders only one chamber is inflated with compressed air. Figure 8-2 shows a &quot;normally open&quot; (NO) 2-way directional valve. Force acts in one direction to control the movement, returns to normal state by an external force such as a spring inside. A three-port valve symbol works in a similar way. Parker telescopic cylinders are 2,000 PSI rated . The theoretical force available in the actuator is the piston area multiplied by the supplied air pressure. When the valve is switched, the two outputs are in opposite modes.
