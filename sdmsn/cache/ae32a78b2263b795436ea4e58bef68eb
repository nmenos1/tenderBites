Prometheus, by contrast, supports the float64 data type with limited support for strings, and millisecond resolution timestamps. InfluxDB uses a variant of a log-structured merge tree for storage with a write ahead log , sharded by time. Graphite is written in Python where InfluxDB is written in Go. This makes Graphite more readily usable for those who are experts in Python programming, though the Go language can be faster with less overhead.

Graphite stores numeric samples for named time series, much like Prometheus does. However, Prometheus's metadata model is richer: while Graphite metric names consist of dot-separated components which implicitly encode dimensions, Prometheus encodes dimensions explicitly as key-value pairs, called labels, attached to a metric name. By default, enabling the Graphite plugin will allow you to collect metrics and store them using the metric  Following the Prometheus webpage one main difference between Prometheus and InfluxDB is the usecase: while Prometheus stores time series only InfluxDB is better geared  Graphite monitoring will become more or less expensive depending on the resources needed, but it will be very comparable to InfluxDB. 20 0.
