I was only somewhat normal in the estriol 3 category. 2.1. 5 This rare abnormality occurs in one out of every 1,000 pregnancies. Inhibin A and inhibin B tests are two separate tests that measure the levels of these hormones in the blood. What does the quad screen test for in pregnancy? . . High levels of Inhibin A in the blood serum of a pregnant women is indicative of the foetus being affected with down syndrome and as such Inhibin A forms a crucial part of the maternal screening tests for down syndrome in the second trimester of pregnancy.

In addition, because hCG can be elevated in females with trophoblastic disease, germ cell tumors, and other malignancies, it is often used as a prognostic marker and for disease monitoring. The high level of the hormone must be screened with the quad screen blood tests. Elevated levels of inhibin A and/or inhibin B may be present in the blood of a woman with a rare type of ovarian tumor called a granulosa . Inhibin A elevations have been reported in approximately 70% of granulosa cell tumors.

Human chorionic gonadotropin is a 39,500-Da glycoprotein hormone normally found in blood and urine only during pregnancy. If the levels of FSH are low, it could be due to . At 10 to 14 weeks of gestation fetal trisomy 21 is associated with increased maternal serum inhibin-A and free beta-hCG levels. 9,000-210,000. I was only somewhat normal in the estriol 3 category.

Maternal inhibin A levels are correlated with maternal hCG levels and are abnormal in the same conditions that are associated with abnormal hCG levels (eg, inhibin A levels are typically higher in trisomy 21 pregnancies). About 10-30% of most cancer patients (like those with lung, breast, or prostate cancer) have elevated levels of hCG. I received a phone call from a nurse at my OB&#x27;s office who told me my quad test results were in, and that I&#x27;d have to discuss them with the doctor ASAP.
