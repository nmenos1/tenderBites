Wegener failed to explain why the drift began only in Mesozoic era and not before. continents move on conveyor belts. How does glacial evidence support the theory of continental drift? Another important piece of evidence in the Continental Drift theory is the fossil relevance. Glacial evidence has been found in these areas that are much too warm to sustain glacier growth. What evidences support Wegener&#x27;s continental drift theory? Evidence later accumulated from other areas of research, but the theory was not taken seriously until well after Wegener&#x27;s death. The idea of continental drift has been subsumed into the science of plate tectonics, which studies the movement of the continents as they ride on plates of the Earth&#x27;s lithosphere.

The word &#x27;fossil&#x27; was coined more than 500 years ago, by German scientist Georgius Agricola, though records describing fossils are much older. 11 What are three pieces of evidence that support the theory of plate tectonics and Pangea? Second, Wegener noted that plant fossils of late Paleozoic age found on several different continents were quite similar, suggesting that . In Africa, there is grooved bedrock and there are glacial deposits called tillites that are more than 240 million years old. This supports the theory of the Continental Drift, because coal originates from tropical plants, which can only be founded in the tropics.

Other evidence of continental drift is that glacial deposits, glacial grooves, and other glacier evidence have been found in parts of South America, Africa, India, and Australia. But the continent carries with it the fossils and rocks that formed at its previous locations. Copy. Proofs heavily depend on assumptions that are generalistic. These are found along the equator, in areas with a very warm climate. Forces like buoyancy, tidal currents and gravity are too weak to be able to move continents.  Alfred Wegener investigated this field and found an anomaly in the Permo-Carboniferous. What does the theory of continental drift state? The general response to Wegener&#x27;s hypothesis, however, was disbelief. Drawbacks of Continental Drift Theory. Noting the apparent fit of the bulge of eastern . fossil. Glacial Striations: Scratches that are left on bedrock from rocks trapped under a glacier and rubbed along the bedrock. The evidence for continental drift included the fit of the continents; the distribution of ancient fossils, rocks, and mountain ranges; and the locations of ancient climate zones. First, the shape of some continents match, particularly South America and Africa. glaciers are only found in cold areas. Answer: Seismology actually provided some of the most compelling evidence that did more than bring credibility to the idea of continental drift - it led to the theory of plate tectonics, a more holistic view of how our planet works. There is also much climate evidence supporting continental drift, most notable of which is glacial activity. There is also much climate evidence supporting continental drift, most notable of which is glacial activity. Wegener&#x27;s accumulated evidence could be most logically explained by continental drift. In prechristian era, Greek philosophers . Pangaea existed about 300 million years ago. Wegener gathered evidence from different scientific fields to support his ideas about continental drift. Other evidence of continental drift is that glacial deposits, glacial grooves, and other glacier evidence have been found in parts of South America, Africa, India, and Australia. Some Southern Hemisphere geologists, particularly in South Africa, responded with enthusiasm. Evidence in Support of the Continental Drift The Matching of Continents (Jig-Saw-Flt) The shorelines of Africa and South America facing each other have an extraordinary and unmistakable match. Additionally, what evidence did Wegener not support the continental drift hypothesis? animals swim to other continents. Additionally glacial deposits can only come from Antarctica, proving the theory. It may be noted that a map produced using a computer program to find the best fit of the Atlantic margin was presented by Bullard in 1964. This diagnostic sequence consists of glacial deposits called tillites, followed by sandstones and finally coal measures, typical of warm moist climates. Coal is found in Antartica, coal is an organic sedimentary rock that originates from tropical plants founded in the tropics. Provide 4 pieces of evidence in support of the theory of continental drift. Alfred Wegener investigated this field and found an anomaly in the Permo-Carboniferous ice sheet that was found through glacial till deposits to have once covered all . answer choices. Fossils of similar organisms across widely disparate continents encouraged the revolutionary theory of continental drift. When Alfred Wegener first made his case for continental drift, he relied on two main lines of argument: the shape of the continents and the relative positions of glacial till deposits. answer choices. 30 seconds. 41 Votes) Wegeners hypothesis was that all the continents were once joined together in a single landmass and have since drifted apart. See answer (1) Best Answer. Continental drift: It is a theory that assumes all continents of the earth were a part of a single super-continent that later move away from each other. We know that some animals only live in certain areas -- for instance, if you found a fossil of a fish, you would know that at the time when the fish was alive that part of the world was an . continental drift, large-scale horizontal movements of continents relative to one another and to the ocean basins during one or more episodes of geologic time. Evidence for continental drift. Landforms like rivers and mountain ranges match on continents 3. If you look at a map of the world, you might notice what Alfred Wegener noticed - that the continents look as if they could fit together like a big jigsaw puzzle if you were able to move them around. Evidence for Pangaea - The following are a number of reasons why Wegener was able to propose existence of continental drift. . These show the direction of the glacier, and suggest the ice flowed from a single central point. Another evidence that supports the theory of continental drift is Paeomagnetism. 13 What does glacial deposits probably indicate about the overall climate of Pangaea at the time? Coal can be found underneath the cold and dry Antarctic ice cap, though coal can only form in warm and wet conditions. In 1912, Wegener presented evidence that most . Climate Evidence.

Why wasn t Wegener s idea of continental drift accepted by the scientific community. Answer (1 of 19): Continents don&#x27;t drift. The scratches show the direction the glacier was moving and are found. Continents are stationary and do not move. As a continent moves toward the poles, its climate becomes colder. More evidence comes from glacial striations - scratches on the bedrock made by blocks of rock embedded in the ice as the glacier moves. Continents fit together like a jigsaw puzzle Click again to see term  1/16 Previous  Next In the late 1800s and early 1900s, evidence began to grow in support of the hypothesis that the continents had once been connected and had subsequently moved apart over time.

How did fossils provide evidence for continental drift? How did fossils provide evidence for continental drift? This indicates that these . 3. Over a vast period of time, the continents drifted apart to their current locations. Glacial evidence has been found in these areas that are much too warm to sustain glacier growth. This is the study of the strength and direction of the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field as it has changed over geologic time. The Earth&#x27;s continents have not always been where they are at present. The idea of a large-scale displacement of continents has a long history. Alfred Wegener, in the first three decades of this century, and DuToit in the 1920s and 1930s gathered evidence that the continents had moved. There is variety of evidence that supports the claims that plate tectonics accounts for (1) the distribution of fossils on different continents, (2) the occurrence of earthquakes, and (3) continental and ocean floor features including mountains, volcanoes, faults, and trenches. Evidence for Continental Drift. Evidence from the Permo-Carboniferous glaciation Tectonic fit Fossil evidence The evidence is fairly compelling. And this came about unexpectedly. As a continent moves toward the equator, its climate becomes warmer. How does glacial evidence support the theory of continental drift? If the continents were in their present position, a major glaciation event that covered nearly all of the continents and extended north of the equator would be required. Continental Drift. Animal species that are present (today and in the past) that both come from the same common a.

The Theory of Continental Drift was proposed by Alfred Wegener in 1912. This map displays an early &quot;supercontinent,&quot; Gondwana, which eventually moved to form the continents we know today. When atmospheric testing of n. 2.How did glacial deposits provide evidence that Pangaea had exsisted. Glacier evidence was found in places glaciers should never have been 2. Geologists can determine the movement of continental plates by examining the orientation of magnetic minerals in rocks; when rocks are formed, they . Continental Drift Theory The theory that once all the continents were joined in a super-continent, which scientists call Pangaea.
