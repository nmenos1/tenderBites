Among the numerous metabolic effects of GLP-1 are the glucose-dependent stimulation of insulin secretion, decrease of gastric emptying, inhibition of food intake, increase of natriuresis and diuresis, and modulation of rodent -cell proliferation. GLP-1 plays an important role in glucose homeostasis and augments glucose-induced insulin secretion and inhibits glucagon secretion. GLP-1 is known to cause natriuresis in humans, but the effects on basic renal physiology are still partly unknown. .

Although all GLP-1 RAs share the same underlying mechanism of action, they differ in terms of formulations . Since its discovery, GLP-1 has emerged as a pleiotropic hormone with a myriad of metabolic functions that go well beyond its classical identification as an incretin hormone. GLP-1 is secreted by the gut in response to food intake and acts on the brain to regulate appetite and energy expenditure.
