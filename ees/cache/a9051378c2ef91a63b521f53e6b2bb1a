A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.. For example, "ace" is a subsequence of "abcde". All caught up! C. Obtain The String. For each test case, print the answer: in the first line print one integer k (1kn)  the minimum number of subsequences you can divide the string s to. //CodeForces 314C //Analysis: It is equivalent to finding the number of non-descending subsequences of a given sequence. Given a string, count number of subsequences of the form a i b j c k, i.e., it consists of i a characters, followed by j b characters, followed by k c characters where i >= 1, j >=1 and k >= 1.

Note that subsequences 14 and 134 aren't good because in both cases the shortest path passing through the vertexes of these sequences is 134. A subsequence of the string t is such a sequence that can be derived from the string t after removing some (possibly, zero) number of letters without changing the order of remaining letters. Two subsequences are considered distinct if distinct sets of positions are deleted. For example, in the array [1, 1] there are 3 different subsequences: [1], [1] and [1, 1]. Note that a subsequence of s is a string that can be obtained from s by deleting some of its elements. Leaderboard System Crawler 2022-06-02.
