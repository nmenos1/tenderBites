Descriptive statistics are brief descriptive coefficients that summarize a given data set, which can be either a representation of the entire population or a sample of it. Measures of central tendency are examples of descriptive data statistics that depict an overall &#x27;central&#x27; trend of a set of data. . Since it only takes into account the central value, unlike the mean, it is not affected by outliers. If the number of observations is even, the median is the middle point (average) of the two middle values. its value must correspond to an actual score in the data set. (ii) The mode is the class with the largest number of observations. The major advantage of using the median as a central tendency is that it is less affected by outliers and skewed data. the median is the mean of the two middle numbers.
