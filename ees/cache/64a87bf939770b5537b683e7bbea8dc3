Medium Solution Verified by Toppr The energy and momentum of a photon are related by p =E /c. A neutrino (/ nj u  t r i n o / nyoo-TREE-noh; denoted by the Greek letter ) is a fermion (an elementary particle with spin of 1 / 2) that interacts only via the weak interaction and gravity. Since the initial momentum is zero, right, it&#x27;s at rest. If it decayed to a single photon, conservation of energy would require the photon energy to be E = M c 2, while conservation of momentum would require the photon to maintain p = 0.
